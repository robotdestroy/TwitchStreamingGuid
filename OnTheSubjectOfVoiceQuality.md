# On The Subject Of Voice Quality

_A MeowPewPew guest post by Nathan aka [Witha3](https://twitch.com/witha3)_

Previously on Twitch how-to's with MeowPewPew, [Charlie](https://twitch.tv/gargarbot) lead with a [solid starter guide](https://medium.com/@charliedeets/beginners-guide-to-streaming-on-twitch-dc2a7108fbd7) for streaming on Twitch. He covered a ton of stuff, from configuring your stream software to adding character with custom graphics. But there's so much more still that could be discussed when it comes to getting your stream just right. So I'm going to expand on a specific topic that's been near and dear to me since I started streaming regularly two years ago: voice quality.

#### Why care about voice quality?

Lets lay some groundwork. What does voice quality matter so long as you _have_ a mic? Indeed, many big name streamers don't even have particularly good sounding mic setups, so it follows then that this isn't the most important aspect of a stream. If you've got the personality and the drive, that'll take you a long way. I think streaming is about the total experience though, and a big part of that experience for viewers is your voice. It's called attention to detail, folks.

This is especially true if you stream without a camera. Your voice becomes the viewer's entire window into you. The inflections and tone in your voice make up your character along with your personality. So bringing it through crystal clear improves the experience beyond the simple quality boost. But, you know, who doesn't like good sounding stuff? I do.

### 1. Taking your first steps towards better voice

So you've been streaming for a minute (or maybe you're gung-ho from the get-go), and you're ready to up the ante? Sweet. You're in the right spot. When I started out, I was using a $2 lapel mic. It was about as low quality as you could get, but somehow still ended up sounding (slightly) better than a gaming headset mic, proving that you don't have to drop bank to upgrade your stream. Crucially, this also allowed me to talk to my viewers separately from my teammates, which is always good to avoid confusion/annoyance.

Maybe you're already ready to jump a little further ahead than this though -- you're okay with putting some real investment into your streaming. What comes next? Probably a USB mic like the [Blue Yeti](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2/), the go-to mic for all budding streamers.

It's going to set you back about $100, so you might then ask, "Why wouldn't I just go all the way and get a real mic?". And the short answer to that question is: because "real" microphones don't plug into computers. They have to plug into other things that are even more expensive than the mic. And unless you're partnered and full time, that's probably a silly investment this early. But you know, if you have the means, go for it. I'll just be jealous is all.

The longer answer to that question though is that, in my opinion, you don't need a real microphone.

That's not the whole answer. It's longer.

It's the next section.

### 2. The Long Answer (Getting the most out of your USB mic)

So you bought your Blue Yeti™️ so you could get something closer that crispy af voice quality of your favorite streamer. Cool. That's what I did. You and me, we're not so different. But then you plugged it in and your heart quickly sank because it didn't actually sound that much better than your $2 lapel mic, and certainly nothing resembling Cool-Guy McASMR streamer (this is just a joke, I don't actually watch ASMR streams [I don't even know what it stands for (please don't tell me)]).

Fret not, there's secrets yet shared. And they don't even require an audio engineering degree. Are you ready? Turn the gain all the way down and get real close to the mic. I'm talking inches from your mouth, the fewer the better (you'll probably want to buy a [pop filter](https://www.amazon.com/Earamble-Studio-Microphone-Filter-Shield/dp/B06WVFRW4H/) or foam windscreen). Then turn the input level in Windows (Sound Settings > Recording Devices) down until you're just loud enough for your viewers to hear without them groaning (this was about 75 for me). They'll turn you up, trust me, but be sure to turn your game volume down to compensate.

>Tip: Pay attention to the settings on your microphone. For example, the Yeti has a dial and usually you'll want it on the cardioid setting (looks like a heart). On this setting, you'll want to talk towards the _front_ of the microphone, not the top. 

What effect will this have? Well, it'll make you louder. Like, a whole lot louder. But more than that, it'll also broaden the spectrum of your voice. The highs will be clearer, and the lows will be deeper. Basically, it'll get you closer to that top tier radio quality sound. Not all the way. Maybe only about halfway. But that's still some serious improvement from a $100 USB microphone.

I'm using a Yeti in this video, configured exactly how I've described.

I was fairly happy when I got to this point. I rode this setup out for quite some time. However, I never stopped looking for the next way to improve my sound. And recently, I made a breakthrough. One that I think has gotten me significantly further than halfway to the perfect sound. Closer than I ever thought I could get without buying new hardware.

>Tip: If you're having trouble getting the mic close enough to your face without blocking it, you may want to invest in a [boom arm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DY1F2CS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). (This one is not rated for heavy mics like the Yeti, but with some elbow grease you can tighten down the nuts till she holds steady. Trust me.)

>Tip for the tip: If you've attached the boom to your desk and now you're picking up every click and tap in your mic, you could drop the coin on a [shock mount](http://a.co/hpDTGnC), OR you could shove some cardboard or other sound padding in between the clamp and your desk.

### 3. That Next Level Sh*t

Okay, so now you're ready to spend a little bit more money, but still not Jay-Z money. I got you bb. There is pride in having a well polished stream, even if you're not trying to be the next DrDisrespect (no one needs to try to be that). Turns out, if you lack the requisite hardware for high quality audio, you can fake it with software. And faking it is nearly as good.

There's probably options for what software you want to use, but I've been using Adobe Audition ($20/mo). Not because I've done any research and determined it is the best; I just found a tutorial with accompanying config file that prevented me from having to learn anything about how audio engineering software works, which is key here.

![](superoverwhelmingAAscreenshot.jpeg)
Because if I had to figure any of this stuff out for myself it'd be RIP.

The guide I followed is from a streamer by the name of [Psynaps](https://www.twitch.tv/psynaps), and it's solid so I'll just [refer you directly](http://www.psynapticmedia.com/stream-voice-audition-obs/) rather than try to regurgitate it for you. In it he covers the complete setup process for your mic, Adobe Audition, VAC (used for routing audio), and OBS. Most importantly, he shares his own Audition configuration file so that all you have to do is load it up and you'll have a good sounding baseline to work from (or just roll with).

>Note: I didn't use VAC, I used an alternative called [Breakaway Pipeline](http://www.breakawayone.com/downloads/) that I already had installed. Works just the same.

#### Fine Tuning (optional)

I took the opportunity to personalize my sound. The options in Audition can be dizzying, but it's not too bad. Just rely on your ears. I recommend pulling up a stream from someone whose sound is close to what you want to go for and referencing it while you tweak your own settings.

The main two places where you'll want to spend time first are the **Parametric Equalizer** and **Multiband Compressor**. Modifying these will make the most drastic difference right off and ultimately form the backbone of your sound. After that, really the only other effect I tweaked was **Dynamics Processing**, which primarily pulls out background noise and raises your voice.

>Tip: Record a quick clip of yourself speaking at your typical volume, temporarily set Audition's output to your headphones instead of VAC, and loop the recorded clip while playing around with all the effects until you land on your ideal sound profile.

#### Gotchas

One of the pitfalls of going full software in your audio solution is that it adds a substantial delay from when you speak to when the audio actually hits OBS. Potentially up to a full second. This may not sound like that big of a deal, but the gap can become very apparent in situations where you're reacting to something surprising on screen, for example. And if you use a camera, well, it'll be super obvious.

Fixing the latter of those problems is relatively easy, thankfully. Most streaming applications offer ways to delay video input, and you can use them to sync your camera to your voice in a jiffy. The first problem can become a lot more complicated though, and I haven't found a solution yet. For now, I'm simply running all of my gameplay (even from my PC) through my capture card, which adds a natural few hundred milliseconds of delay. It's not perfect, but it closes the gap enough to not be as jarring. This is a tradeoff I'm comfortable making, but probably not everyone will be.

### Closure

[Blah blah blah etc]. I feel like my voice quality really stands out now, which is exactly what I wanted. I'm not all the way to the best sounding streamers on Twitch, but I am content with how close Audition has gotten me. At least content enough to not invest in real hardware.
