# On The Subject Of Voice Quality

_A MeowPewPew guest post by Nathan aka [Witha3](https://twitch.com/witha3)_

Previously on Twitch how-to's with MeowPewPew, [Charlie](https://twitch.tv/gargarbot) lead with a [solid starter guide](https://medium.com/@charliedeets/beginners-guide-to-streaming-on-twitch-dc2a7108fbd7) for streaming on Twitch. He covered a ton of stuff, from configuing your stream software to adding character with custom graphics. But there's so much more still that could be discussed when it comes to getting your stream just right. So today we're going to expand on a specific topic that's been near and dear to me since I started streaming regularly two years ago: voice quality.

### Why care about voice quality?

Well I assume you wouldn't be reading if you didn't care, but I suppose it's good to lay some groundwork. What does voice quality matter so long as you _have_ a mic? Indeed, many big name streamers don't even have particularly good sounding mic setups, so it follows then that this isn't the most important aspect of a stream. If you've got the personality and the drive, that'll take you a long way. I think streaming is about the total experience though, and a big part of that experience for viewers is your voice. It's called attention to detail, folks.

This is especially true if you stream without a camera. Your voice becomes the viewer's entire window into you. They build a concept of who you are through the inflections and tone in your voice, and bringing that through crystal clear ensures your viewers feel an even closer connection with you. Plus, you know, it sounds good. Who doesn't want good sounding stuff? I do.

### Taking your first steps towards better voice

So you've been streaming for a minute (or maybe you're gung-ho from the get-go), and you're ready to up the ante? Sweet. You're in the right spot. When I started out, I was using a $2 lapel mic. It was about as low quality as you could get, but somehow still ended up sounding (slightly) better than a gaming headset mic, proving that you don't have to drop bank to upgrade your stream. Crucially, this also allowed me to talk to my viewers separately from my teammates, which is always good to avoid confusion/annoyance.

Maybe you're already ready to jump a little further ahead than this though -- you're okay with putting some real investment into your streams. What comes next? Probably a USB mic like the [Blue Yeti](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2/), the quintessential go-to mic for any budding streamer.

It's going to set you back about $100, so you might then ask, "Why wouldn't I just go all the way and get a real mic?". And the short answer to that question is because "real" microphones don't plug into computers. They have to plug into other things that are even more expensive. And unless you're partnered and full time, that's probably a silly investment. But you know, do it if you have the means. I'll just be jealous is all.

The longer answer to that question though is that, IMO, you don't need a real microphone. That's not the whole answer. It's longer. It's the next section.

### The Long Answer

So you bought your Blue Yeti™️ so you could get something closer that crispy af voice quality of your favorite streamer. Cool. That's what I did. You and me, we're not so different. But then you plugged it in and your heart quickly sank because it didn't actually sound that much better than your $2 lapel mic, and certinaly nothing resembling Cool-Guy McASMR streamer (this is just a joke, I don't actually watch ASMR streams [I don't even know what it stands for (please don't tell me)]).

Fret not, there's secrets yet shared. And they don't even require an audio engineering degree. Are you ready? Turn the gain all the way down and get real close to it. I'm talking inches from your mouth, the fewer the better (you'll probably want to buy a [pop filter](https://www.amazon.com/Earamble-Studio-Microphone-Filter-Shield/dp/B06WVFRW4H/) or foam windscreen). Then turn the input level in Windows (Sound Settings > Recording Devices) down until you're just loud enough for your viewers hear without them groaning. They'll turn you up, trust me (but be sure to turn your game volume down to compensate).

What effect will this have? Well if you haven't gone and tried it yourself, I'll go ahead and spoil it for you: it'll make you louder. Like a whole lot louder. But more than that, it'll also broaden the spectrum of your voice. The highs will be clearer, and the lows will be deeper. Basically, it'll get you closer to that top tier radio quality sound. But not all the way. Maybe about halfway. But that's still some serious progress from a $100 USB microphone.

>Tip: Pay attention to the settings on your microphone. For example, the Yeti has a dial and usually you'll want it on the cardioid setting (looks like a heart). On this setting, you'll want to talk towards the _front_ of the microphone, not the top. 

>Tip: If you're having trouble getting the mic close enough to your face without blocking it, you may want to invest in a [boom arm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DY1F2CS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). (This one is not rated for heavy mics like the Yeti, but with some elbow grease you can tighten down the nuts till she holds steady. Trust me.)

>Tip: If you've attached the boom to your desk and now you're picking up every click and tap in your mic, you could drop the coin on a [shock mount](http://a.co/hpDTGnC), OR you could just shove some cardboard or other sound padding in between the clamp and your desk.

I was pretty content when I got to this point, and rode this setup out for quite a while. However, I never stopped looking for the next way to improve my sound (without going for the big hardware purchase). And recently, I made a breakthrough.

### That Next Level Sh*t
